Parameters Concepts:

1. w_com

This term balance the domain range between leading descriptor and the completing
 descriptor.

2. ws_lead = 1

We want to preserve the original optimization parameters of SoftPN. (For both loss
 function and learning rate) Therefore this term is fixed to 1.

3. ws_pro

This term enhances the importance of our optimization target, product score. If this
 term is 1, then the product score will be equally important as the SoftPN loss
 function, and the optimization of product score will fail since the loss function will
 tend to optimize the SoftPN loss function.

For example, if the leading descriptor is real-valued 128 dim descriptor, and it is way
 stronger than the completing descriptor which is 256 bits binary descriptor. Then we
 set ws_pro a big value (at least bigger than 1), for example ws_pro=5.
